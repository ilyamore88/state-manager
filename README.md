# State manager

In this repo I've created an example of the State manager. As a reference, I used the Redux state manager.

## Build library

Run:

```shell
yarn build:ts
```

## Develop server

For a develop server I used Vite. If you want to use Vite dev server, run:

```shell
yarn dev
```

## Build demo

Run:

```shell
yarn build
```
